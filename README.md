# Diet-Recommendation-for-Diabetic-patients-using-Machine-Learning
## Overview
  The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to recommend personalized diet plans for diabetic patients by analyzing their specific type of diabetes and individual body characteristics. The study focuses on understanding the relationship between key factors such as BMI, age, sex, and type of diabetes to make informed dietary recommendations.It aims to provide accurate and tailored diet plans that cater to the unique needs of each patient. This approach not only enhances the effectiveness of diabetes management but also contributes to improving the overall quality of life for individuals with diabetes through personalized healthcare solutions.
## Data understanding
  The dataset comprises 300 records of diabetic patients, capturing essential variables such as age, sex, BMI, cholesterol levels, type of diabetes, and other related health metrics. Age and sex provide demographic insights, which are crucial for analyzing trends in diabetes prevalence and severity across different groups. BMI, a key indicator of body fat, is included to explore the relationship between obesity and diabetes. Cholesterol levels, often linked to cardiovascular health, offer additional context for understanding how lipid profiles might interact with diabetes management. The dataset also categorizes patients by type of diabetes (e.g., Type 1, Type 2), allowing for an in-depth analysis of the differences in disease mechanisms and treatment approaches. Overall, this dataset offers a comprehensive foundation for studying the multifaceted aspects of diabetes and its management.
## Model and Evaluation
  In this study, we developed and evaluated machine learning models such as —Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and a Multi-Target Classifier—to predict appropriate diet plans for diabetic patients based on a dataset.The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 96%, while the Naive Bayes and Multi-Target Classifier models both achieved higher accuracies of 97%. These models were thoroughly evaluated, and the results indicate that the Multi-Target Classifier, in particular, demonstrates strong predictive performance, effectively identifying personalized diet recommendations for diabetic patients based on their individual characteristics.
## Conclusion
  In conclusion, the development and evaluation of the models on a dataset of diabetic patients demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in personalized healthcare. These models provide reliable predictions for tailored diet plans based on critical factors such as BMI, age, sex, and type of diabetes. The strong performance, particularly of the Multi-Target Classifier, highlights the potential of these approaches to enhance dietary recommendations, ultimately supporting better management of diabetes and improving patient outcomes.
